# Crypto-Bot-Binance
A bot for [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) that uses Bollinger Bands strategies to make money. It was made in three days in a hackathon from my internship at TORA Trading Services.

# DEMO

# Motivation: Why Bollinger Bands and Why a Bot?
The main theme for this hackathon was to do **anything we want with Binance/Kraken's APIs**, so to do an application with crypto currencies. I have always wanted to try creating a bot for trading, and I thought: what better time than know? 

## Day 1
The first challenge was the fact that **I didn't know anything about trading**, not a single term. So, for my first task, I reserved some of my time to learn some terms. After that, I searched what I needed to know for a trading bot. Then I found a keyword: **TRADING STRATEGIES**. 

The next Google search was _"What is the easiest trading strategy to learn?"_ and the answer was: **Bollinger Bands strategy**. I had no idea at that time what those words meant, and the internet didn't help, since there were a lot of new terms...especially because the strategy's idea is **BUY HIGH SELL LOW**, which is the opposite of what you should always do in trading. Also, these strategies usually work for stocks, not crypto, since crypto is very unpredictable.

Fortunately, I found a(video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G9fHBEsauE]
explaining much better the strategy
